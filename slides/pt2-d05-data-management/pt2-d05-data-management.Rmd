# Week 5 - Learning Objectives

1. Learners can use a tool for survey design for 12 to 15 questions ~~using at least two elements of survey logic~~

2. Learners can apply 12 principles for data organisation in spreadsheets in the layout of a collected dataset

3. Learners understand the importance of documentation and metadata for (research) data management

# Research Data Management

> Acronym: RDM. Refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project. It covers initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing. Shortened to RDM. - [Reference](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/glossary.html#term-Research-Data-Management)

---
# Research Data Management

- ensures efficiency in research workflows
- enables greater reach and impact ([FAIR principles](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html?highlight=fair))
- prevents loss and data corruption
- documentation and metadata ensures access and enables reuse for others

???
1. You will always find your data
2. You get recognition for all research outputs
3. You stimulate collaboration who find it easier to understand and reuse your data

The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship were developed as guidelines to improve the:

- **Findable:** The first step in (re)using data is to find them! Descriptive metadata (information about the data such as keywords) are essential.

- **Accessible:** Once the user finds the data and software they need to know how to access it. Data could be openly available but it is also possible that authentication and authorisation procedures are necessary.

- **Interoperable:** Data needs to be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows.

- **Reusable:** Data should be well-described so that they can be used, combined, and extended in different settings.

all of which support research reproducibility. The FAIR principles play an important role in making your data available to others for reuse.

### Point out

1. Planning research

- data management plans right in the beginning when you design your research

2. Collecting data

- We will get into capturing data with metadata

3. Processing and analysing data

- That's what will start from week 8

4. Publishing and sharing data

- That's what most of today is about
- We have already talked about licenses

5. Preserving data

- Store and backup: You are continously doing that by the use of a remote repository (GitHub)

6. Re-using data

- That's what we hope to be able to do following the course and include you all as co-authors of a publication

## Data Management Plan

Provides information on five main topics:

1. Roles and Responsibilities
2. Type and size of data collected and documentation/metadata generated
3. Type of data storage used and back up procedures that are in place
4. Preservation of the research outputs after the project
5. Reuse of your research outputs by others

### Data Management Plan Instructions for ETH Zurich Researchers

**Section 1: Data collection and documentation**

- 1.3 What documentation and metadata will you provide with the data?
    - What information about your data (i.e., metadata) is required to make reuse of your data in the future?
    - Are you using certain community standards for the annotation of metadata?
    - How will data documentation be carried out?
    
.footnote[[Data Management Plan Instructions for ETH Zurich Researchers](https://documentation.library.ethz.ch/display/DD/Data+Management+Plan+Instructions+for+ETH+Zurich+Researchers)]

---
#### Q1: What information about your data (i.e., metadata) is required to make reuse of your data in the future?

- Codebook or data dictionaries that define and explain all variables in your data
- A human and machine-readable file (e.g. README.md) that contains general information on:
    - Title of the dataset
    - Description of the dataset
    - Author information (Name, Institution, Address, Email)
    - Date of data collection (begin, end)
    - Geographic location of data collection
    - etc.
- A license to clarify reuse possibilties

---
#### Q2: Are you using certain community standards for the annotation of metadata?

- General metadata standards (e.g. [DublinCore](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/), [schema.org](https://schema.org/), [R3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/))
- Domain specific standards (**we won't get into this**)

---
#### Q3: How will data documentation be carried out?

- Repository hosted on GitHub with license that clarifies use: [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) 
- Respository has `/data` directory which contains:
  - **Codebook** (stored as `attributes.csv`) that describes all variables following [schema.org](https://schema.org/) standards
  - **README** hat contains information for each dataset, following variation of [Cornell University README template](https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate)

---
## File naming conventions 

**Why?**

- to stay organised
- to not end up with: `'text is FINAL_v2-Ls.docx'`

---
## File naming conventions - Directories and files

**Rule 1:** Avoid capital letters

`project/rbtl/website/data/`

(if you want them, be consistent)

---
## File naming conventions - Directories and files

**Rule 2:** Avoid empty spaces

`project/rbtl/website/data/tab-01-rbtl-assignments.csv`


---
## File naming conventions - Directories and files

**Rule 3:** Use dash '-' to connect text strings in file names

`tab-01-rbtl-assignments.csv`

---
## File naming conventions - Directories and files

**Rule 4:** Avoid special characters (e.g %, ¬£)

---
## File naming conventions - Directories and files

**Rule 5:** Use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format: YYYY-MM-DD

`2022-03-21-waste-characterization-erz.csv`

---
## File naming conventions - Directories and files

**Rule 6:** Use names that are descriptive for the content
