# Research Data Management

> Acronym: RDM. Refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project. It covers initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing. Shortened to RDM. - [Reference](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/glossary.html#term-Research-Data-Management)

---
# Research Data Management

- ensures efficiency in research workflows
- enables greater reach and impact ([FAIR principles](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html?highlight=fair))
- prevents loss and data corruption
- documentation and metadata ensures access and enables reuse for others

???
1. You will always find your data
2. You get recognition for all research outputs
3. You stimulate collaboration who find it easier to understand and reuse your data

The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship were developed as guidelines to improve the:

- Findability, 
- Accessibility, 
- Interoperability and 
- Reusability of digital assets; 

all of which support research reproducibility. The FAIR principles play an important role in making your data available to others for reuse.

### Point out

1. Planning research

- data management plans right in the beginning when you design your research

2. Collecting data

- We will get into capturing data with metadata

3. Processing and analysing data

- That's what will start from week 8

4. Publishing and sharing data

- That's what most of today is about
- We have already talked about licenses

5. Preserving data

- Store and backup: You are continously doing that by the use of a remote repository (GitHub)

6. Re-using data

- That's what we hope to be able to do following the course and include you all as co-authors of a publication

## Data Management Plan

Provides information on five main topics:

1. Roles and Responsibilities
2. Type and size of data collected and documentation/metadata generated
3. Type of data storage used and back up procedures that are in place
4. Preservation of the research outputs after the project
5. Reuse of your research outputs by others

## Data Management Plan Instructions for ETH Zurich Researchers

**Section 1: Data collection and documentation**

- 1.3 What documentation and metadata will you provide with the data?
    - What information about your data (i.e., metadata) is required to make reuse of your data in the future?
    - Are you using certain community standards for the annotation of metadata?
    - How will data documentation be carried out?
    
.footnote[[Data Management Plan Instructions for ETH Zurich Researchers](https://documentation.library.ethz.ch/display/DD/Data+Management+Plan+Instructions+for+ETH+Zurich+Researchers)]

---
#### Q1: What information about your data (i.e., metadata) is required to make reuse of your data in the future?

- Codebook or data dictionaries that define and explain all variables in your data
- A human and machine-readable file (e.g. README.md) that contains general information on:
    - Title of the dataset
    - Description of the dataset
    - Author information (Name, Institution, Address, Email)
    - Date of data collection (begin, end)
    - Geographic location of data collection
    - Information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data
- A license to clarify reuse possibilties

---
#### Q2: Are you using certain community standards for the annotation of metadata?

- General metadata standards (e.g. [DublinCore](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/), [schema.org](https://schema.org/), [R3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/))
- Domain specific standards (**we won't get into this**)

---
#### Q3: How will data documentation be carried out?

- Repository hosted on GitHub has data folder
- Data folder contains
  - one codebook (stored as CSV) that describes all variables following guidelines in [OSF - How to Make a Data Dictionary](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019739054-How-to-Make-a-Data-Dictionary)
  - of all datasets following [schema.org](https://schema.org/) standard
  - one README per dataset that contains general information for each dataset, following variation of [Cornell University README template](https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate)
  - a LICENSE that clarifies the use of data [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
