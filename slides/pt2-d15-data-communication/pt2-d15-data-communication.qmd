1. Part 1: Exam advice and practice
    - Programming exercise
2. Part 2: Data communication
    - Live Coding Exercise
3. Part 3: What comes next?
4. Part 4: Evaluation
5. Part 5: Individual work and questions

# Learning Objectives

1. Learners can use ~~R Markdown~~ Quarto and GitHub to publish ~~their group project~~ a report.

2. Learners can use exported references from Zotero in Better BibTex Format to generate an automated reference list. [Assignment 3 - YouTube Video - 13:58](https://youtu.be/yWlSeqhZCNM?t=838)

3. Learners can cross-reference figures and tables within an R Markdown file.

## Workflow 

::: {.incremental}

- Briefly read through each section at the beginning to see what's coming
- 20 tasks coding tasks in four sections  
- Points for each task are shown
- Work through the sections

:::

```

## Workflow 

::: {.incremental}

- No cloning repositories in this exam
- No commits during the exam time (one commit after the exam time ends)
- No pushing to GitHub in this exam

:::

## Rules 

::: {.incremental}

- Headphones (music) allowed
- Stick Notes or raised hand for support (no loud calling)
- No talking with each other
- Individual work (0 points of code is shared)

:::

## Practice Exam

**ae-15-data-communication**

1. Head over to the GitHub Organisation for the course.
2. Find the repo for week 15 that has your GitHub username.
3. Clone the repo with your username to the RStudio Cloud.
4. Open the file: `ae-15a-communicate.qmd`
5. Use your Sticky Notes to let me know when you are ready.

## Work through the tasks

```{r}

countdown(
  minutes = 25, seconds = 0,
  left = 0, right = 0,
  padding = "10px", margin = "5%",
  font_size = "2em"
)

```

## Step-wise points {.smaller}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

ggplot(data = waste_data_long_mean, 
       mapping = aes(x = mean_percent, 
                     y = waste_category, 
                     fill = income_cat)) + # 1
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) + # 1
  labs(title = "Waste Composition", # 0.5
       subtitle = "Mean percentages ...", # 0.5
       x = "mean (percent)", # 0.5
       y = "waste category", # 0.5
       fill = "Income category", # 0.5
       caption = "Data from: ...") + # 0.5
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 50, 5)) + # 1
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 3) + # 1
  theme_minimal() + # 0.5
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # 0.5
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) # 0.5
  
```

## What to study?

- Practice writing code 
- All tasks are coding tasks and a small set of YAML header tasks
- Nothing Git or GitHub related

# Part 2: Data communication {background-color="#0F4C81"}

## Live Coding Exercise

**ae-15-data-communication**

1. Back to `ae-15a-communicate.qmd`

## Captions and cross-references {.smaller}

- no space between `{r}` and `#| tbl-cap: "A table"`
- spelling tbl not tab
- no spaces (use dashes in `label`)

See @tbl-simple-table...

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "A table"
#| label: tbl-simple-table
#| echo: fenced

tibble(
  id = c(1, 2, 3),
  name = c("X", "Y", "Z")
) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

# Part 3: What comes next? {background-color="#0F4C81"}

## Research Project Report

- Due date: **9th of June 23:59**
- No commits after that point will be accepted

## rbtl community meetup events
