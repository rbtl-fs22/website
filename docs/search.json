The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to GitHub, which you will be using throughout the course to manage your programming assignments and group project work.\nIn this part of the course, you will be learning by doing. You are not expected to understand each step that you perform, but rather be exposed to new terminology and concepts that will feel unfamiliar. You will gain familiarity over the next 14-weeks as you develop repetitive workflows and become more experienced with the tools.\nPrerequisites\nWe assume that you have:\nA laptop or a PC (a tablet device would not be sufficient)\nOne of Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (just not the Internet Explorer)\nRead the Syllabus for this course\nWe do not expect any prior knowledge of git, GitHub, R, or RStudio.\nLearning Objectives\nIn this unit, you will learn to:\nCreate a profile on GitHub\nCreate a repository on GitHub\nTurn a repository on GitHub into a public GitHub Pages website\nEdit a CSV file in the instructor’s public class repository to add their name, GitHub user ID, and a functioning URL for GitHub Pages website they have just created\nInitiate a pull request to the instructor’s repository\nCreate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)\nTerminology\nVersion control software: Version control software allows you to effectively “save” your work at important points in time and come back to any of the save points. It is also an easy way to share code with others so they can download, re-use, contribute.\nGit: A version control system.\nGitHub: A web platform for hosting version controlled files and facilitating collaboration among users.\nRepository: A Git repository contains all of your project’s files and stores each file’s revision history. It’s common to refer to a repository as a repo.\nIn this course, each assignment you work on will be contained in a Git repo.\nFor individual assignments, only you will have access to the repo. For team assignments, all team members will have access to a single repo where they work collaboratively.\nAll repos associated with this course are housed in the course GitHub organization. The organization is set up such that students can only see repos they have access to, but the course staff can see all of them.\n\nTasks\nFollow along with the instructions in the video below for this assignment and complete all steps on your own. Part of the steps is to create a username for GitHub. You can find guidance for a good username here: https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html\nFill out this survey: https://evaluation-app1.let.ethz.ch/TakeSurvey.aspx?SurveyID=l81Jn923\nVideo\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe material on this page is influenced by and partly taken from: datasciencebox.org licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.\n\n\n\n",

In this next assignment, you will setup your RStudio Cloud infrastructure which we will you to work with R and the RStudio IDE. You will follow through another set of tasks that will expose you to the workflow we will use in this course. Once again, we do not expect you to understand exactly what you are doing at each step. The main purpose is to set you up and expose you to the tools before we get going with your own data in Week 8.\nPrerequisites\nWe assume that you have:\nCompleted Assignment 1 of this course. If you have not, follow the instructions here: https://rbtl-fs22.github.io/website/am-01-hello-github.html\nStored your GitHub Personal Access Token in a secure and accessible place.\nLearning Objectives\nIn this unit, you will learn to:\nClone a repository from GitHub into the RStudio Cloud\nRender an R Markdown file using the RStudio IDE\nCommit changes to files in a repository using the RStudio IDE\nPush tracked changes to GitHub\nTerminology\nR Markdown: A dialect of Markdown that allows authors to mix prose and code (usually written in R) in a single document. [glosario reference]\ngit commit: As a verb, the act of saving a set of changes to a database or version control repository. As a noun, the changes saved. [glosario reference]\ngit clone: Copies (and usually downloads) of a Git remote repository on a local computer. [glosario reference]\ngit push: Uploads and synchronizes changes between a local repository and a remote repository. [glosario reference]\nremote repository: A repository located on another computer (e.g. GitHub). Tools such as Git are designed to synchronize changes between local and remote repositories in order to share work. [glosario reference]\nlocal repository: A copy of a repository that we use as our primary workspace where we create, edit, and delete files. This copy is commonly referred to as the local repository. The local repository most commonly exists on our computer or laptop, but can also exist within a workspace on a server (e.g. RStudio Cloud, JupyterHub). [text reference]\nTasks\nYou have received an email invitation from GitHub to join the GitHub Organisation (rbtl-fs22) for this course. If you have not, please make sure that you completed Assignment 1 first and then contact Lars by email.\nJoin the RStudio Cloud Workspace for the course (Login with your GitHub details) by clicking on the following link: https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/220982/join?access_code=2AJpQzpiRMtZfQpDEYhx__e72_MaCdFX3TSFoZGE\nFollow through with the instructions in the video below to complete the remaining tasks\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It will teach you how to conduct an applied research project.\nPart 2: In this part you will learn how analyse your data with R and how to use git version control and GitHub for collaboration. It will teach you to apply Open Science principles to your research with a focus on computational resproducibility of your research.\nIn the beginning, the lectures overlap. You will receive in person lectures and assignments with videos as homework. Later on, once you have your data, there will be a set of lectures that solely focuses on Part 2.\nHomework\nYou will receive 10 homework assignments, each of which need to be submitted to progress in the course. All homework assignments are submitted through GitHub and you will receive instructions on how do that for each individual homework assignment. Each homework assignment is worth 2%, and if it’s submitted on time you will receive 2%. For late submission, we will deduct 1% for the assignment.\nResearch Project\nYou may have heard the term “evidence-based policy-making”. It’s a very obvious concept that policies and decisions should be made based on data—not on feelings, politics or history (which is unfortunately, more commono than you think).\nHowever, the data required to provide evidence of a problem, a trend, or changing need is often costly, time-consuming, and usually beyond the scope of what most government officials or departments can do. Decision-makers rely on researchers to help them with the data and evidence that they need to make informed choices.\nThat’s where you come in.\nIn this course, you will work on a project that broadly addresses the theme of “Trash in the Public Spaces of Zurich” and will submit your findings to the ERZ Entsorgung + Recycling Department at Stadt Zürich.\nWe want you to address a real problem in the real city and send your findings to a real decision-maker.\nSpecifically, Stadt Zürich is interested to know more about:\nThe composition of waste in public spaces;\nThe producers of trash in publish spaces;\nThe influence of the location on trash in public spaces;\nThe appearance and nuisance of public trash (bins) in public spaces;\nPerceptions of public space users towards trash in public spaces;\nbut you will design your own study with your own research questions and collect the data that you need to answer your question.\nWe will work with ERZ to access public bins (you can collect, weigh, and characterise real trash!). So, while you are free to design your own study, you cannot access other sources of trash (for ethical reasons).\nThe goal of this hands-on approach is three-fold:\nTo give you the experience of working through a “field study” as is common when investigating a question in another country (typically a poor one);\nTo provide much-needed evidence to ERZ who does not have the time or resources to do their own data collection; and\nTo generate your own data that can be used as you work through the R-based exercises that will build your skills as researcher who contributes to open-science.\nNow let’s talk trash!\nImportant: Statistical significance is not the goal and will not teach you statistical methods in this course that go beyond basic summary statistics. The practice and experience of conducting an applied research project is important.\nGroup Work\nGroups of five will work to answer the a research question using a variety of methods. You will work together as a group and submit one final report, but each of you will develop their own data collection tools and collect your own data. The group is responsible to submit a final report that is graded (see Grading Structure for details). Details for the report structure and the technical details on how to submit the report will be shared throughout the course.\nData\nWe will teach you how to collect and analyse three main data types:\nType 1: Laboratory / Observational / Sensor data\nThis is quantitative data. For example from:\nLaboratory analysis (organics, solids, nutrients, microbiology, etc.)\nObservational (counting, weighing and categorizing)\nSensor data (air quality)\nType 2: Survey questionnaire (e.g. demographics and behaviour)\nThis is quantitative data. For example from:\nHousehold survey questionnaire (family size, income, hours in a park per day, etc.)\nType 3: Secondary data\nThis is open data, which is publicly available. For example from:\nOpen Data Stadt Zurich: https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/\nOpen Data Canton Zurich: https://www.zh.ch/de/politik-staat/opendata.html?keyword=ogd#/home\nOpen Data Switzerland: https://opendata.swiss/de\nGIS Browser Canton Zurich: https://maps.zh.ch/ (Note: We do not teach how to work with spatial data in this course)\nIt can be any of the data from the categories above or any other data that you feel comfortable analysing with R.\nEnd-of-semester exam\nThere is a practical 2-hour end-of-semester exam, which assesses the technical skills (using R, git, and GitHub) taught during the course. It contains programming exercises using the R programming language and you can use any material that you want. The success of the exam depends on the effort put into the compulsory continuous performance assessment.\nGrading scheme\nGrading scheme in summary:\nEnd-of-semester exam: 50 points\nCompulsory continuous performance assessment: 50 points, of which\nHomework: 20 points (n = 10)\nResearch project report: 30 points, of which\nTechnical parts of submitted report: 20 points (we will communicate what we expect)\nIntellectual framing of results: 10 points (we will communicate what we expect)\n\n\nTable 1 shows the conversion from points to grades. Grades follow the ETHZ’s Grading System. Points are rounded to the nearest grade, for example:\n97 points = 5.75\n65 points = 4.50\n64 points = 4.25\n45 points = 4.00\n44 points = 3.50\n\n\nTable 1: Conversion from points to grades.\n\n\ngrade\n\n\npoints\n\n\n6.00\n\n\n100\n\n\n5.75\n\n\n95\n\n\n5.50\n\n\n90\n\n\n5.25\n\n\n85\n\n\n5.00\n\n\n80\n\n\n4.75\n\n\n75\n\n\n4.50\n\n\n70\n\n\n4.25\n\n\n60\n\n\n4.00\n\n\n50\n\n\n3.50\n\n\n40\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n30\n\n\n2.50\n\n\n20\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n10\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n0\n\n\nPolicies\nClass attendance\nWe hope that you can attend class in person. If you do not feel comfortable to attend class in person, we expect you to contact us and inform us about it. There will be a live streaming recording that you can watch from home, however we will not accomodate for two way communication.\nIf you miss a class, we expect you to work through the material of the class using the recording of the live streaming.\nCode of Conduct\nThis course follows the ETH Respect Code of Conduct. If you have not yet read this Code of Conduct, please familiarize yourself with it. If you experience inappropriate behaviour from us or any of your classmates, you will find contact and advice services here: https://respekt.ethz.ch/en/contact-and-advice-services.html\n\n\n\n",
