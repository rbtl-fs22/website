The goal of this\nassignment is to introduce you to GitHub, which you will be using\nthroughout the course to manage your programming assignments and group\nproject work.\nIn this part of the course, you will be learning by doing. You are\nnot expected to understand each step that you perform, but rather be\nexposed to new terminology and concepts that will feel unfamiliar. You\nwill gain familiarity over the next 14-weeks as you develop repetitive\nworkflows and become more experienced with the tools.\nPrerequisites\nWe assume that you have:\nA laptop or a PC (a tablet device would not be sufficient)\nOne of Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (just\nnot the Internet Explorer)\nRead the Syllabus for this course\nWe do not expect any prior knowledge of git, GitHub, R, or\nRStudio.\nLearning Objectives\nIn this unit, you will learn to:\nCreate a profile on GitHub\nCreate a repository on GitHub\nTurn a repository on GitHub into a public GitHub Pages website\nEdit a CSV file in the instructor’s public class repository to add\ntheir name, GitHub user ID, and a functioning URL for GitHub Pages\nwebsite they have just created\nInitiate a pull request to the instructor’s repository\nCreate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)\nTerminology\nVersion control software: Version control software\nallows you to effectively “save” your work at important points in time\nand come back to any of the save points. It is also an easy way to share\ncode with others so they can download, re-use, contribute.\nGit: A version control system.\nGitHub: A web platform for hosting version\ncontrolled files and facilitating collaboration among users.\nRepository: A Git repository contains all of your\nproject’s files and stores each file’s revision history. It’s common to\nrefer to a repository as a repo.\nIn this course, each assignment you work on will be contained in a\nGit repo.\nFor individual assignments, only you will have access to the repo.\nFor team assignments, all team members will have access to a single repo\nwhere they work collaboratively.\nAll repos associated with this course are housed in the course\nGitHub organization. The organization is set up such that students can\nonly see repos they have access to, but the course staff can see all of\nthem.\n\nTasks\nFollow along with the instructions in the video below for this\nassignment and complete all steps on your own. Part of the steps is to\ncreate a username for GitHub. You can find guidance for a good username\nhere: https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html\nFill out this survey: https://evaluation-app1.let.ethz.ch/TakeSurvey.aspx?SurveyID=l81Jn923\nVideo\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe material on this page is influenced by and partly taken from: datasciencebox.org\nlicensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.\n\n\n\n",

A online learning community was\nformed that work through the book together. The book is an excellent\nresource for you to continue your path of working with R beyond the\nscope of what we can teach in our rtbl course.\nThe book is full of code examples that you can copy and run yourself.\nIt is good practice to do that in a notebook specifically used for this\npurpose. We have setup a notebook repository for you, which you can use\nin parallel to reading the book. It is up to you how many notes you want\nto take or whether you want to try and work through the exercises in the\nsections that we assign to read as homework.\nLearning programming in R is a long journey, which requires\ncontinuous practice. It is more beneficial to work three times one hour\nper week, then one day a week for three hours. When you learn\nprogramming, the journey never ends, but you will move from being a novice, to\nbeing a competent\npractitioner, and finally to being an expert. Your\ninterest and motivation will show which direction you will take, but\nusing R4DS as learning material will provide you with a very solid\nfoundation that can be extended into many others areas of using R for\nyour work.\nOpen the rbtl-fs22 GitHub organisation and clone the notebook repo\nwith your name (notebook-[GITHUB_USERNAME]) to the rbtl-fs22 workspace\non RStudio Cloud.\nRead Chapter Introduction of R4DS: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html\nRead Chapter Data Visualisation (3.1 to 3.6) of R4DS: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html\nNote: If you use the notebook to take notes while working\nthrough R4DS, then use the Render, Add, Commit, Push workflow every now\nand then to push your changes back to GitHub and keep your remote\nrepository in sync with your local repository.\n\n\n\n",

It will teach you how to conduct an applied\nresearch project.\nPart 2: In this part you will learn how analyse your data with R and\nhow to use git version control and GitHub for collaboration. It will\nteach you to apply Open Science principles to your research with a focus\non computational resproducibility of your research.\nIn the beginning, the lectures overlap. You will receive in person\nlectures and assignments with videos as homework. Later on, once you\nhave your data, there will be a set of lectures that solely focuses on\nPart 2.\nHomework\nYou will receive 10 homework assignments, each of which need to be\nsubmitted to progress in the course. All homework assignments are\nsubmitted through GitHub and you will receive instructions on how do\nthat for each individual homework assignment. Each homework assignment\nis worth 2%, and if it’s submitted on time you will receive 2%. For late\nsubmission, we will deduct 1% for the assignment.\nResearch Project\nYou may have heard the term “evidence-based policy-making”. It’s a\nvery obvious concept that policies and decisions should be made based on\ndata—not on feelings, politics or history (which is unfortunately, more\ncommono than you think).\nHowever, the data required to provide evidence of a problem, a trend,\nor changing need is often costly, time-consuming, and usually beyond the\nscope of what most government officials or departments can do.\nDecision-makers rely on researchers to help them with the data and\nevidence that they need to make informed choices.\nThat’s where you come in.\nIn this course, you will work on a project that broadly addresses the\ntheme of “Trash in the Public Spaces of Zurich” and will submit your\nfindings to the ERZ Entsorgung + Recycling Department at Stadt\nZürich.\nWe want you to address a real problem in the real city and send your\nfindings to a real decision-maker.\nSpecifically, Stadt Zürich is interested to know more about:\nThe composition of waste in public spaces;\nThe producers of trash in publish spaces;\nThe influence of the location on trash in public spaces;\nThe appearance and nuisance of public trash (bins) in public\nspaces;\nPerceptions of public space users towards trash in public\nspaces;\nbut you will design your own study with your own research questions\nand collect the data that you need to answer your question.\nWe will work with ERZ to access public bins (you can collect, weigh,\nand characterise real trash!). So, while you are free to design your own\nstudy, you cannot access other sources of trash (for ethical\nreasons).\nThe goal of this hands-on approach is three-fold:\nTo give you the experience of working through a “field study” as is\ncommon when investigating a question in another country (typically a\npoor one);\nTo provide much-needed evidence to ERZ who does not have the time or\nresources to do their own data collection; and\nTo generate your own data that can be used as you work through the\nR-based exercises that will build your skills as researcher who\ncontributes to open-science.\nNow let’s talk trash!\nImportant: Statistical significance is not the goal\nand will not teach you statistical methods in this course that go beyond\nbasic summary statistics. The practice and experience of conducting an\napplied research project is important.\nGroup Work\nGroups of five will work to answer the a research question using a\nvariety of methods. You will work together as a group and submit one\nfinal report, but each of you will develop their own data collection\ntools and collect your own data. The group is responsible to submit a\nfinal report that is graded (see Grading Structure\nfor details). Details for the report structure and the technical\ndetails on how to submit the report will be shared throughout the\ncourse.\nData\nWe will teach you how to collect and analyse three main data\ntypes:\nType 1: Laboratory\n/ Observational / Sensor data\nThis is quantitative data. For example from:\nLaboratory analysis (organics, solids, nutrients, microbiology,\netc.)\nObservational (counting, weighing and categorizing)\nSensor data (air quality)\nType 2:\nSurvey questionnaire (e.g. demographics and behaviour)\nThis is quantitative data. For example from:\nHousehold survey questionnaire (family size, income, hours in a park\nper day, etc.)\nType 3: Secondary data\nThis is open data, which is publicly available. For example from:\nOpen Data Stadt Zurich: https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/\nOpen Data Canton Zurich: https://www.zh.ch/de/politik-staat/opendata.html?keyword=ogd#/home\nOpen Data Switzerland: https://opendata.swiss/de\nGIS Browser Canton Zurich: https://maps.zh.ch/ (Note: We do not\nteach how to work with spatial data in this course)\nIt can be any of the data from the categories above or any other data\nthat you feel comfortable analysing with R.\nEnd-of-semester exam\nThere is a practical 2-hour end-of-semester exam, which assesses the\ntechnical skills (using R, git, and GitHub) taught during the course. It\ncontains programming exercises using the R programming language and you\ncan use any material that you want.
