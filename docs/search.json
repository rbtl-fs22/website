You are not expected to understand each step that you perform, but rather be exposed to new terminology and concept that will feel unfamiliar. You will gain familiarity over the next 14-weeks as you develop repetitive workflows.\nLearning Objectives\nIn this unit, you will learn to:\nCreate a profile on GitHub\nCreate a repository on GitHub\nTurn a repository on GitHub into a public GitHub Pages website\nEdit a CSV file in the instructor’s public class repository to add their name, GitHub user ID, and a functioning URL for GitHub Pages website they have just created\nInitiate a pull request to the instructor’s repository\nCreate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)\nPrerequisites\nTerminology\nGit: A version control system.\nGitHub: A web platform for hosting version controlled files and facilitating collaboration among users.\nRepository: A Git repository contains all of your project’s files and stores each file’s revision history. It’s common to refer to a repository as a repo.\nIn this course, each assignment you work on will be contained in a Git repo.\nFor individual assignments, only you will have access to the repo. For team assignments, all team members will have access to a single repo where they work collaboratively.\nAll repos associated with this course are housed in the course GitHub organization. The organization is set up such that students can only see repos they have access to, but the course staff can see all of them.\n\nTasks\nFollowing along with the instructions in the video for this assignment and complete all tasks\nFill out this survey: https://evaluation-app1.let.ethz.ch/TakeSurvey.aspx?SurveyID=l81Jn923\nAcknowledgements\n\n\n\n",

With the goal to improve the human condition with technology, we designed this course to teach learners how to conduct a research project out of the lab, and apply open science principles to their data analysis projects.\n            Over the course of the semester, students will develop a research project and learn the necessary quantitative methods required to collect data from people. We will use tidyverse R packages to work with data, and git and GitHub as tools for version control and collaboration. By the end of the course, students will have a complete overview of how a typical field-based research project is designed, implemented and communicated.\n            Content will be delivered through lectures and tutorials. The success of the course will depend on the student’s own willingness to engage with local challenges, stakeholders, citizens and agencies in order to develop a comprehensive body of work that answers a relevant, local problem.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Research Beyond the Lab: Open Science and Research Methods for a Global Engineer\n              Thursday at 15:00 - 18:00 IFW A 32.1151-8102-00L4 ECTS\n              From the proverbial ‘field’ to the heart of Zurich, engineering research is guided by the same fundamental principles.
