# Goals for today

You...

...know a bit about me and I know a bit about you. 

...know the learning outcomes and competencies you gain in this course.  

...are aware of the tools that we use for this course.

...know where to find the link to the course website.  

...understand the grading scheme for this course.  

...are motivated to do your homework and come back next week.

- Welcome to rbtl

- Using open-source (free) tools, you will learn how to gather data, intrepret results, and clearly communicate findings.

- You will learn how to make sense of different kinds of data, how to tell whether something is probably true or not. 

- You will learn how to manage your data and a little bit of statistics and some basic programming skills, 

- but more importantly, you will know how to apply all that to real-world problems in academia, business and society.

Websites. The website I designed for this course is made with R. Once you know the basics of how to work with one R, then you can do this in no longer than 30 minutes.
