# Learning Objective

> Learners can apply **ten** functions from the `dplyr` R Package to generate a **subset of data** for use in a **table** or **plot**

# Notes for exam {background-color="#0F4C81"}

## Notes for exam - practise!

- tempting to copy/paste (especially from others)
- practise as much as you can
- read instructions carefully
- identify instructions are phrased

## Notes for exam - levels of difficulty

- fill in the blanks
- detailed instructions with named functions
- basic instructions with analysis goals

# Homework Assignment 11 {background-color="#0F4C81"}

# Data wrangling with dplyr  {background-color="#0F4C81"}

## A grammar of data wrangling... {.smaller}

... based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: chooses rows based on location
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `relocate`: changes the order of the columns
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- `group_by`: for grouped operations
- ... (many more)

## dplyr rules

Rules of `dplyr` functions:

::: {.incremental}

- First argument is always a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame  
- Don't modify in place
