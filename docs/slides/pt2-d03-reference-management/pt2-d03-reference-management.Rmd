# Why?

- You will read a lot
- You want to stay organized
- You don't want to waste your time on formatting

---
# Which tool?

- Mendeley 
- EndNote
- Zotero
- many, many more

???

**Mendeley**

1. Mendeley belongs to Elsevier. 
2. It encrypts your database and makes money with your data
3. You can only collaborate with 3 people on one project.

**EndNote**

1. EndNote doesn't come free, you need to buy a license. 
2. They also used a prioprietary citation style files that could only be opened by EndNote.

# Zotero is Open Source - Why is that good?

- Free Software
- Transparent about access to your own data
- The source code that Zotero is developed in is public
- Commitment to support open software and open standards
- Zotero developers helped create the open [Citation Style Langauge (CSL)](https://citationstyles.org/)

.big[Open Source != Open Data]


???

- Refers to the practice of sharing the data that produces your results
- This is especially important if you write code that depends in the data - 
- the code can’t usually be re-run without it.
