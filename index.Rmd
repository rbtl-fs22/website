# Research Beyond the Lab: Open Science and Research Methods for a Global Engineer
  
**Thursday at 15:00 - 18:00 IFW A 32.1**  
**151-8102-00L**  
**4 ECTS**

**Prof. Elizabeth Tilley**  
**Lars Sch√∂bitz**

From the proverbial 'field' to the heart of Zurich, engineering research is guided by the same fundamental principles. With the goal to improve the human condition with technology, we designed this course to teach learners how to conduct a research project out of the lab, and apply open science principles to their data analysis projects.

Over the course of the semester, students will develop a research project and learn the necessary quantitative methods required to collect data from people. We will use tidyverse R packages to work with data, and git and GitHub as tools for version control and collaboration. By the end of the course, students will have a complete overview of how a typical field-based research project is designed, implemented and communicated.

Content will be delivered through lectures and tutorials. The success of the course will depend on the student's own willingness to engage with local challenges, stakeholders, citizens and agencies in order to develop a comprehensive body of work that answers a relevant, local problem.
