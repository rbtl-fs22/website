  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  pull(learning_objectives_pt1)

```

1. `r lobj1[1]`
2. `r lobj1[2]`

## Part 2

```{r}

lobj2 <- read_csv(here::here("data/tab-01_rbtl-learning-objectives.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  pull(learning_objectives_pt2)

```

1. `r lobj2[1]`
2. `r lobj2[2]`
3. `r lobj2[3]`

# Slides

```{r}

read_csv(here::here("data/tab02_rtbl-slides-resources.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  select(title, lecturer, part, slides) %>%

# Group work

1. Decide, within your group, who will take each of the five papers in  (groups of 5:  1 person for each paper)
2. Read your paper for next class. Pay close attention to:
    - The research question
    - The methods the authors use to collect their data
    - The variables (and units) that are measured
    - The types of analysis that is used to answer the research question
3. You will use your paper to inspire conversations within your group as you work through the subsequent exercises in the coming weeks.
4. Enjoy!
