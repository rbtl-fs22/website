# Learning Objectives

This lecture consists of two parts, each of which have specific learning objectives. 

## Part 1 

```{r}

lobj1 <- read_csv(here::here("data/tab-01_rbtl-learning-objectives.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  pull(learning_objectives_pt1)

```

1. `r lobj1[1]`
1. `r lobj1[2]`
1. `r lobj1[3]`

## Part 2

These learning objectives are related to the assignment for this week.

```{r}

lobj2 <- read_csv(here::here("data/tab-01_rbtl-learning-objectives.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  pull(learning_objectives_pt2)

```

1. `r lobj2[1]`
1. `r lobj2[2]`
1. `r lobj2[3]`

# Slides

```{r}

read_csv(here::here("data/tab-02_rtbl-slides-resources.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  select(title, lecturer, part, slides) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE, position = "left")

```

# Group work

The submission is part of Assignment 4. Each ~~group~~ person will:

1. Add the research questions that you and/or your group have worked on.
2. Write up the research design you are planning to use for your data collection.
3. Submit their sample population:
  - Bins: (1) Number; (2) Location, (3) Frequency of sampling
  - Human population, for example random, over 60, family, cyclist, etc.
4. Write up the variables that are needed, together with the respective questions and possible response values.
