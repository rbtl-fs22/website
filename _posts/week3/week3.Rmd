title: "Week 3 - Research Design"
description: |
  Having a good research design will ensure that you are not “comparing apples to oranges”. We discuss the sample population, the concept of randomization, and classic study designs.

# Learning Objectives

This lecture consists of two parts, each of which have specific learning objectives. 

## Part 1 

```{r}

lobj1 <- read_csv(here::here("data/tab-01_rbtl-learning-objectives.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  pull(learning_objectives_pt1)

```

1. `r lobj1[1]`
1. `r lobj1[2]`
1. `r lobj1[3]`

## Part 2

These learning objectives are related to the assignment for this week.

```{r}

lobj2 <- read_csv(here::here("data/tab-01_rbtl-learning-objectives.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  pull(learning_objectives_pt2)

```

1. `r lobj2[1]`
1. `r lobj2[2]`

# Slides

```{r}

read_csv(here::here("data/tab-02_rtbl-slides-resources.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  select(title, lecturer, part, slides) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE, position = "left")

```


# Group work

- Groups will decide on a research design, a sample population, and revise the research questions if necessary. Each group will present their new design next week.

# Homework

```{r, layout="l-page", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

read_csv(here::here("data/tab-03_rbtl-course-assignments.csv")) %>% 
  filter(week == params$week) %>% 
  mutate(id = seq(1:n())) %>% 
  select(id, title_link, type,  category, effort_estimate_min, submission_format, due_date) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(7, width = "10em", background = "#E8ADAA")
